# [ info ]
  
Dead useless client that receives no good updates nowadays
  
I was hoping that the security was improved but literally nothing was changed since Crystallinqq's crack
  
# [ how-to ]

</div>

1. Download package.zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/PlutoSolutions/Abyss/releases)
0. Put everything into your .minecraft/mods folder (NOT .minecraft/mods/1.12.2)
0. Start the game

<div align="center">
  
If the crack fails to load and rocket drm shits out some string errors or crashes then your java is too new
  
jdk1.8.0_241 works, download it from [here](https://mega.nz/file/fOoEAQBa#xowIZlFHlfhGLI-XlBGyvx2OkC856r3jaAOt3hewJkw)
  
# [ issues ]
  
</div>

1. This client doesn't work with Konas for some reason (non cracked one)
0. Also doesn't work with old versions of gamesense
2. idk i forgot who cares
